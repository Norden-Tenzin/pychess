- server - is the host
- client - is the joinee

	- give code to cleint - player 
	- client uses code to join the server  - code could be ip add and port
	- client connects - to server
	- goes to lobby
		- in lobby we set game settings
			- such as: 
				- piece color 
				- time limit - TODO for now unlimited.
			- click start to go to game
				
	- At start game
		- set pieces to client and server  - depends on what piece color picked
		
	- in game
		- white goes first.
			- need to make a blocking function - to stop playeer from moving pieces when they shouldnt be able to.
		- at every move
			- if client moves
				- its gonna send game data to server to change board
					- lift blocking on server
					- like move knight from __ to __ - have this in somesort of json or something. 
					
					- wont send data for false move tried. only moves that are valid. 
					- 
			- if server moves
				- send data to client to change the board
					- lift the blocking on client
					-  i want it to take care of valid invalid moves on the player side.
